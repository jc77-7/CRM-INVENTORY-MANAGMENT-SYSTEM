This Project is about integrating CRM( CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT SYSTEM) & IMS(INVENTORY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM).
I have primarily built a GUI Window application using Python (tkinter) and SQLite3 for database.
It is useful for startups, medium-sized shops.
I have chosen SQLite3 because it doesn't need internet to function and can be used by shop owners residing in remote areas too.
Further enhancements are going on to automate it using AI.
I have initially got this idea from youtube which had only IMS but I additionally added CRM to it i.e visualizations and lot more to add.
